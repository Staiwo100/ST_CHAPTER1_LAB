**#Reflection Questions**

**##1. What was the most challenging part of translating from Python concepts to Java syntax?**  

  To me, the most challenging part of translating Python concepts to java syntax is that everything has to be in a class. Another challenging change is the syntax for while loops and if else statements.

**##2. When did you use AI assistance and what did it help you with?**  
  I used AI assistance on the third problem when I faced problems with the finished part of my code. Before the AI assistance, when i entered a wrong value on the guessing game, the code would print out "Too low!" or "Too high" forever. The AI simply told me that the reason this was happening was because my guess variable was not updating so it wouldn't give me the chance to put in another input. The fix to this was putting the Input statement inside the while loop

**##3. Was there anything in Java that you liked better than in Python?**  
  Despite the change, I do like how the if else statements work as well as the while statements compared to python. To me, doing it this way is less confusing. I also like how boolean operators do not have to be capitalized as that tripped me up a lot in python.
